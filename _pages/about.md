I am a Masters (by Research) student at IIIT Hyderabad working with [Prof. Pawan Kumar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pawan.kumar/myhomepage/) for my thesis. I am also working with [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on feature matching under high viewpoint changes. 

Before joining IIIT Hyderabad, I have worked at [CDAC](https://www.cdac.in/) on NLP for Indian Language and Computer Vision for crowd management, received scholarship for [School of AI](https://picampus-school.com/programme/school-of-ai/) program at Pi School, and had to opportunity to work with early stage startups.

I finished my undergraduate degree from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in Electronics and Telecommunication.

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, optimization and generalization. Focus of my masters research is build build algorithms geared towards generalizable multi-agent scenarios. I'm also interested learning algorithms which leverage the causal structure in the world. 

I am also obsessed about knowledge management and recently got addicted to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
