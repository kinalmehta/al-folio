I am a Masters (by Research) student at IIIT Hyderabad working with [Prof. Pawan Kumar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pawan.kumar/myhomepage/). I finished my undergraduate degree from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in Electronics and Telecommunication.

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, optimization and generalization. Focus of my masters research is build build algorithms geared towards generalizable multi-agent scenarios. I'm also interested learning algorithms which leverage the causal structure in the world. 

As a side project I am also working with [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on feature matching under high viewpoint changes.

I am also obsessed about knowledge management and recently got addicted to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
